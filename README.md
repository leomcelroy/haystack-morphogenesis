# Haystack Labs 2022: Design Tools

Over the course of Haystack Labs Lingdong and I made a series of design tools.
We originally set out to make some tools which would allow artists to design natural shapes, and did make a few,
but we also took a detour into making some tools for Pensa's in-development wire bending machine.

# Swarm Interpolation

You can play with the tool [here](https://leomcelroy.com/haystack-morphogenesis/swarm-interpolation-v3/).

Our first tool grew out of a series of conversations with Kate Reed. 
It allows the designer to specify cross-sections of a shape. 
These cross sections are then connected by a swarm of particles which perserve certain features between intermediate cross-sections (like the number of islands).

You can see the tool running below:

We used the Potterbot which Phirack brought to print an "A" which morphs into a "B".

# Some Background

The projects above grew out of investigating morphogenesis design tools for Haystack Labs 2022 with Kate Reed, Lingdong Huang, and myself.
Some of the earlier investigations can be found [here]().
